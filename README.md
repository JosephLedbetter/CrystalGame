<h1> Crystal Game </h1>

<h3> About </h3>
<p>The Crystal Game is based solely on the idea of memorization and adding the value of certain gems until you reach the 
desired score posted by the computer. All values, desired number & crystal values, are generated at random. Your goal is 
to memorize the value of each crystal and 'click' to add each value to the total number in attempts to equal the computer 
number. If you go over, you lose and the loss it reflected on your win/loss tracker.</p>
